# A-Pair-of-Diophantine-Equations-and-Fibonacci-Like-Sequences
This paper surveys recent results on finding the solution and determining which equation is used when  and  are taken from certain sequences. We contribute to the literature by finding  when  and  are consecutive terms of sequences having the Fibonacci recurrence and arbitrary initial terms.
