Given two relatively prime numbers **a** and **b**, it is known that exactly one of the following two Diophantine equations has a nonnegative integral solution **(x, y)**:

$$
ax + by = \frac{(a - 1)(b - 1)}{2}
$$

or

$$
1 + ax + by = \frac{(a - 1)(b - 1)}{2}
$$

Furthermore, the solution is unique.  

This work surveys recent results on finding the solution and determining which equation is used when **a** and **b** are taken from certain sequences. Our contribution is to find **(x, y)** when **a** and **b** are consecutive terms of sequences that follow the Fibonacci recurrence with arbitrary initial terms.
